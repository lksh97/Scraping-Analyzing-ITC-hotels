# Scraping and Analyzing ITC hotels

 Scrapped the basic information available on Trip Advisor for 15 ITC hotels across different parts of India, and 1000 reviews for each hotel. Stored it in a CSV file. Performed Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, wrote Summary of Insights and attached the reference to it. Used BeautifulSoup as an HTML parser, Pandas for data manipulation, Regular Expression for searching the pattern, geocode for finding the co-ordinates, Numpy for numerical calculations, folium, Squarify, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualisation and nltk library for NLP.
